<hr />

<p>Iâ€™m currently on the job hunt! People have asked me what kind of roles I am looking for - I thought instead it might be easier to just write up a brief :)</p>

<p>I wrote this to help you decide if Iâ€™m the right fit for you!</p>

<p>You can learn more about my professional experiences via my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alifinkelstein">LinkedIn</a>. Instead, Iâ€™ll use this section to talk about where Iâ€™m at career wise, and what interests me.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a planner at heart - when I propose an idea, Iâ€™ve probably already mapped out the first 5 steps in my head. However, when it comes to planning what I want to do next Iâ€™m actively at a crossroad. I have found so many paths that fascinate me, but one thing about the paths stays true: the ability to directly help.</p>

<p>I love to support and be the person thinking about how I can help you achieve your goals. I love to have a genuine connection and utilize it to move the team forward, together. I enjoy jobs where I can use my ability to connect with people, as well as my technical background.</p>

<p>What is most important to me right now is the people Iâ€™ll be working with, and not always the product. As I move forward trying to navigate my future career path, I hope to surround myself with exceptionally talented people that are as eager to learn from me as I am eager to learn from them.</p>

<p>As I sit in this spot and think about what to do next, I look at the crossroads ahead of me - thereâ€™s many jobs / career paths / fields I am deeply excited about. Here are some topics that interest me:</p>

<p>SaaS: SaaS isâ€¦ everything. Everything we touch at some point comes into the world by way of some kind of SaaS product. Simple things that we take for granted everyday - from Gmail to the point of sales system used to pay for your groceries - all utilize SaaS. SaaS has already eaten the world - and helps people live their everyday life. SaaS makes lives easier and helps people connect around the world. SaaS tools have helped me all throughout my life (shout out to Quizlet for getting me through middle school!), and I love being able to work on tools that help people like how SaaS has helped me.</p>

<p>Community: Community is everything - especially in the technology world. We see companies explode in popularity due to amazing communities, and have seen companies fail due to failing their community. Community is a great place to find like thinkers, people looking to help, people looking for help, and just a person to talk to. Iâ€™ve been fascinated with friendships and connections in the after education world, and have found that communities are the answers. Theyâ€™re just fascinating!</p>

<p>Venture Capital: I think its so amazing how venture capital can change the world. Venture enables impact creation from the bottom up, enabling founders to create, build, and accelerate their company, touching the lives of millions - a butterfly effect. Beyond the capital injection, the community aspect that venture capital fosters is a feat. As a founder who has worked in both resource rich San Francisco and alternative locations like Miami, I have first hand experience seeing the power of community. I do believe that exceptional founders will thrive in all environments, but VCâ€™s investment in the community is a movement I deeply support.</p>

<p>Internet Culture: The internet is important to me - I would not be here today without it. Thanks to Facebook groups, Twitter threads, and Instagram DMs, Iâ€™ve made my best friends. Trends are fascinating, and watching the internet grow from just a tool to a culture has been fascinating. I still reflect and think back to the days when memes were just top text / bottom text, and how we came to memes that are just â€œBLOCâ€. Internet trends can be harnessed to change the world (one of the reasons why Iâ€™m working with <a href="https://2020upto.us">2020upto.us</a>), and how influencers have changed the sales market. Internet culture is like a secret language - either you know it or you donâ€™t, and if you find someone else who speaks it, you can write beautiful music (read: have hilarious conversations). Also, Iâ€™m always ready to deliver a good meme on request.</p>

<p>Security: Iâ€™ve always been interested in securityâ€¦ you just wouldnâ€™t have known. I learned about the study of security while as a junior in college - took the security class as soon as I could the following year. I was ecstatic about what I was learning - so much so, I started studying and preparing for the class weeks before it started. It was one of the harder classes I took at MIT, but definitely one of the more interesting. Iâ€™ve continued to try and learn more about security outside of school, by attending security conferences, reading, as well as taking a CTF class. Itâ€™s a fascinating field - I take my own personal tech security very seriously.</p>
