I"­<p>new nose, new hair, new city, new job, new life, new year, who dis?</p>

<hr />
<p>Letâ€™s recap my 2017:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Graduated MIT</strong> with my Masters of Engineering</li>
  <li>Got <strong>hired</strong> (at a amazing company)</li>
  <li>Visited <strong>3 countries</strong> (excluding my travels in the US)</li>
  <li>Had <strong>major surgery</strong> (breathing was hard, now it is better)</li>
  <li>Moved to a <strong>new city</strong> (and moved twice)</li>
  <li>Picked up <strong>trampolining</strong> (itâ€™s so much fun)</li>
</ul>

<p>Until now, I always had subliminal societal goals in mind:</p>

<p>During high school, it was â€œget good gradesâ€ and â€œget into collegeâ€. During college, it was â€œget an internship for the summerâ€ and â€œget hiredâ€.</p>

<p>I call them subliminal because they were persistent goals that were there in my life, all the time.</p>

<p>I call them societal because I feel like I never distinctly selected for myself. Instead I was told these were my goals, the things I should achieve.</p>

<p>But Iâ€™ve moved past those stages in my life, and out of the stage where people can make goals for me. I had this realization mid-November.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Now that Iâ€™ve left education and have moved in to what we call â€œReal Lifeâ€, I realized that I have no more subliminal societal goals. No one is there to make these goals for me.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since then, Iâ€™ve started to plan a bit more about the things I want to do. I havenâ€™t made myself any overarching subliminal goals yet. I do have some ideas for smaller goals for 2018, but I donâ€™t want to formally call them goals - Iâ€™ll call them ambitions. While many of these ambitions are tied to my work and what I do as a developer evangelist, they are still things Iâ€™ve wanted to do for a long time, but due to education, I never had the time.</p>

<p>I now publish these ambitions for you to see, because someone once said that putting your goals (AMBITIONS) out there for all to see makes them far more likely for them to be manifested.</p>

<ol>
  <li>get verified on Twitter</li>
  <li>publish a blog post once a month</li>
  <li>publish a video once a month</li>
  <li>stream on Twitch once a week</li>
  <li>#50daysofmakeup</li>
  <li>talk at 6 conferences</li>
</ol>

<p>I tried to make these ambitions as reasonable as possible. Some can be combined together if I needed, but I really want to invest time into these.  Some of these things are more attainable than others. I was recently told that Twitter is not currently verifying people. Getting accepted to talk at conferences is dependent onâ€¦ wellâ€¦ if I get accepted to talk at conferences. All tips on how to make my ambitions become real are appreciated!</p>

<p>If you see me in real life, poke me about my ambitions. I know Iâ€™ll need the reminders.</p>

<p>Also, keep an eye on this blog. Itâ€™s a work in progress - as I post, itâ€™ll keep evolving.</p>
