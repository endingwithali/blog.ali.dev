# The Story
I was assigned with writing tests using images for an endpoint I created at work. The tests and endpoints were written in Javascript using Jest and Node.js, respectively. I figured it wouldn’t be too difficult — opening a file or image is something I’m familiar with in Java and Python, but the only experience I had doing this in Javascript was when there was a frontend available to pass in the image information. I had some idea of how to do this, so I was determined to figure it out on my own instead of turning to others to get the direct answer. But, as we all know — knowing how to do something in one language doesn’t mean you understand how to do it in another language. I ended up struggling to figure out exactly how to open the image and be able to pass it as a variable and convert it to base64 without acquiring it from a frontend.(Spoiler alert: I ended up asking people)

# The Process
In order to clear up exactly how to do this, I turned to the place (almost) everyone turns to when they have a question: Google.

I executed a total of 31 unique queries. I also ended up asking two separate groups of people for how to do this:

include image in javascript test body
<br/>
image as variable javascript
<br/>
image as variable javascript testing
<br/>
image as variable javascript backend
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
read local file filereader
<br/>
jest test with image
<br/>
json send image
<br/>
**_ask coworker_**
<br/>
base 64 to buffer
<br/>
readFileSync

# The Final Solution

It was a total of two lines of code. Use the method [`readFileSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfilesync_path_options) and then convert to a 
base64 string. In code:

```
var imgFile = readFileSync(pathToImage)
var fileStr = imgFile.toString(“base64”)
```

For those curious, `readFileSync` returns a type of `type { ext: 'jpg', mime: 'image/jpeg'}` which can then be converted to `base64`.

Simple.

I hope this article helps you streamline your image working process, and save you 31 unique Google queries.
