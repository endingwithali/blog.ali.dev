One day passes, and another one is here to spend looking for a job.

It's absolutely tiring looking for a job - I get it. I've had to do it more than I'd like to admit, but I promise, you'll get there. The *Perfect Job* will come to you - eventually. 

I can promise that - don't give up yet. 

But what do you do to get there? How do you nail the job search process? 

I'm here to give some light and resources you can utilize to make your job hunt as painless as possible.

A little bit of insight about me - 
I'll be the first one to say it: I've struggled to find jobs, I've struggled to get offers, I've absolutely flopped at interviews.

When I was in college, I started stressing and searching for full time jobs the summer of my rising senior year. I ended up putting my job search on hold for a few months, 2 years later, after over 100 different job things - interviews, calls, on sites, coding projects, etc. At that point I was very burned out. Luckily, after the break I hit the ground running and was able to get hired a few months later.

Since then, I've been on and off on the job search - it's a process I've come to refine and grow.  Now, I have a set of steps, tools, and actions I go through to make sure I cover as much ground as efficiently and as strongly as possible. 
 

... hmm... That last paragraph sounds a bit rocky - since starting my job search stress, I've had a lot of ups, a lot of downs. Through the iteration process, for my most recent job search experience I was able to make it to final rounds of companies and receive two full time offers in just a 2 month period. I'm very proud of this. 

The job hunt process does not need to involve reinventing the wheel. They say that the job hunt is a full time job on its own - which is true. You can spend endless hours a day searching for companies, networking, and doing outreach, completely forgetting to even prepare for the technical aspect of the interviews.

<br/>

I'll say it one more time. You do not need to reinvent the wheel. It's okay to use shortcuts and see what other people have done. Use the knowledge that is out there. 

With that...

I'm giving you my job search secrets.
