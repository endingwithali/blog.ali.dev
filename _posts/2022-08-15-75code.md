## About the  75 Code Challenge

75 Code has been designed to challenge you while holding you accountable. The goal is to get you into the groove of fitness while encouraging you to keep your coding interview skills sharp and prepared. Each day has actionable tasks that can be completed and marked off a to do list, creating a sense of accomplishment for you, the participant. I hope this challenge encourages some consistency and growth in your journey!

## Inspiration

I originally learned about the [75 hard](https://andyfrisella.com/pages/75hard-info), and subsequently the [75 soft](https://kimandkalee.com/health/75-soft-challenge/) challenge from a YouTuber I was watching a while back. I kept the challenge tucked in my mind as something I could never do (hahaha). Eventually, I was laid off from my job, so it was back to the interview grind for me. Prepping for my FAANG (MANGA?) interview, I went onto Leetcode and picked coding problems at random to complete, hoping I would remember enough of the critical thinking skills I needed to pass the screening rounds. As I was discussing my interviews with a friend, and the haphazard prepwork I did, he said “Why don’t you try doing the Blind 75 questions?”

I had never heard of it before. He explained that it was a series of questions someone had compiled from the LeetCode website that cover all the basic concepts you need to know to be able to answer questions asked during FAANG interviews.   

It all snapped into place - Blind 75, 75 Hard…..

I adjusted the challenge to follow more of the 75 Soft philosophies, to make accomplishing each goal achievable each day and realistic (like capping out at 1 hour of working on the LeetCode problem) while still encouraging personal growth.

So, I present to you, the 75Code challenge! I hope you enjoy. If you’re participating, use the hashtag **#75code** (and/or tag me `@endingwithali`).  I’ll be posting on [Tiktok](tiktok.com/@endingwithali) and live streaming on [Twitch](live.ali.dev) working through my leetcode problem everyday - so come join me!
